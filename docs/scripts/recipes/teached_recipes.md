# teached_recipes.py

Project Zomboid Wiki Taught Recipes Generator

This script processes items in Project Zomboid that teach recipes (like recipe books
or VHS tapes) and generates wiki markup showing which recipes each item teaches.
It creates individual files for each item that contains recipe teaching information.

The script handles:
- Parsing item data for recipe teaching properties
- Generating formatted wiki markup with recipe links
- Creating individual files for each teaching item
- Proper bot flag markup for wiki integration
